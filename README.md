# NUTRITIONAL FACTS

## ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) 1.6.3 or newer.

* [Python](https://python.org/) 2.6 or newer (Python 2+3 compatible).

* [QtPy](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy) 1.1.0 or newer.

* [argparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) 1.1 or newer.
  argparse is part of the stdlib in Python 2.7; install argparse separately if
  you are running on Python 2.6.

* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) for building the documentation.

*git-cola* uses *QtPy*, so you can choose between *PyQt4*, *PyQt5*, and
*PySide* by setting the `QT_API` environment variable to `pyqt4`, `pyqt5` or
`pyside` as desired.  `qtpy` defaults to `pyqt5` and falls back to `pyqt4`
if `pyqt5` is not installed.

Any of the following Python Qt libraries must be installed:

* [PyQt4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
  4.6 or newer

* [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
  5.2 or newer

* [PySide](https://github.com/PySide/PySide)
  1.1.0 or newer

Set `QT_API=pyqt4` in your environment if you have both
versions of *PyQt* installed and want to ensure that PyQt4 is used.

*NOTE*: *git-cola* includes a vendored copy of its *QtPy* dependency.

We provide a copy of the `qtpy` module when installing *git-cola* so that you
are not required to install *QtPy* separately.  If you'd like to provide your
own `qtpy` module, for example from the `python-qtpy` Debian package, then use
`make NO_VENDOR_LIBS=1 ...` when invoking `make`, or export
`GIT_COLA_NO_VENDOR_LIBS=1` into the build environment.

Python3 users on debian will need to install `python3-distutils` in order
to run the Makefile's installation steps.  `distutils` is a Python build
requirement, but not needed at runtime.


## ADDITIVES

*git-cola* enables additional features when the following
Python modules are installed.

[send2trash](https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash) enables cross-platform
"Send to Trash" functionality.

# BREWING INSTRUCTIONS

## RUN FROM SOURCE

You don't need to install *git-cola* to run it.
Running *git-cola* from its source tree is the easiest
way to try the latest version.

    git clone git://github.com/git-cola/git-cola.git
    cd git-cola
    ./bin/git-cola
    ./bin/git-dag

Having *git-cola*'s *bin/* directory in your path allows you to run
*git cola* like a regular built-in Git command:

    # Replace "$PWD/bin" with the path to git-cola's bin/ directory
    PATH="$PWD/bin":"$PATH"
    export PATH

    git cola
    git dag

The instructions below assume that you have *git-cola* present in your
`$PATH`.  Replace "git cola" with "./bin/git-cola" as needed if you'd like to
just run it in-place.

# DOCUMENTATION

* [HTML documentation](https://git-cola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* [git-cola manual](share/doc/git-cola/git-cola.rst)

* [git-dag manual](share/doc/git-cola/git-dag.rst)

* [Keyboard shortcuts](https://git-cola.github.io/share/doc/git-cola/hotkeys.html)

* [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# INSTALLATION

Normally you can just do "make install" to install *git-cola*
in your `$HOME` directory (`$HOME/bin`, `$HOME/share`, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    make prefix=/usr install

The platform-specific installation methods below use the native
package manager.  You should use one of these so that all of *git-cola*'s
dependencies are installed.

Distutils is used by the `Makefile` via `setup.py` to install *git-cola* and
its launcher scripts.  distutils replaces the `#!/usr/bin/env python` lines in
scripts with the full path to python at build time, which can be undesirable
when the runtime python is not the same as the build-time python.  To disable
the replacement of the `#!/usr/bin/env python` lines, pass `USE_ENV_PYTHON=1`
to `make`.

## LINUX

Linux is it! Your distro has probably already packaged git-cola.
If not, please file a bug against your distribution ;-)

### arch

Available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-cola/).

### debian, ubuntu

    apt install git-cola

### fedora

    dnf install git-cola

### gentoo

    emerge git-cola

### opensuse, sle

    zypper install git-cola

### slackware

Available in [SlackBuilds.org](http://slackbuilds.org/result/?search=git-cola).

## Ubuntu

The default version on 18.04 is older and is missing features and enhancements.
Use this [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~pavreh/+archive/ubuntu/git-cola)
maintained by @pavreh to get a newer version.

## MAC OS X

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the easiest way to install
git-cola's *Qt4* and *PyQt4* dependencies.  We will use Homebrew to install
the git-cola recipe, but build our own .app bundle from source.

[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html) is used to build the
documentation.

    brew install sphinx-doc
    brew install git-cola

Once brew has installed git-cola you can:

1. Clone git-cola

    `git clone git://github.com/git-cola/git-cola.git && cd git-cola`

2. Build the git-cola.app application bundle

    ```
    make \
        PYTHON=$(brew --prefix python3)/bin/python3 \
        PYTHON_CONFIG=$(brew --prefix python3)/bin/python3-config \
        SPHINXBUILD=$(brew --prefix sphinx-doc)/bin/sphinx-build \
        git-cola.app
   ```

3. Copy it to _/Applications_

    `rm -fr /Applications/git-cola.app && cp -r git-cola.app /Applications`

Newer versions of Homebrew install their own `python3` installation and
provide the `PyQt5` modules for `python3` only.  You have to use
`python3 ./bin/git-cola` when running from the source tree.

### UPGRADING USING HOMEBREW

If you upgrade using `brew` then it is recommended that you re-install
*git-cola*'s dependencies when upgrading.  Re-installing ensures that the
Python modules provided by Homebrew will be properly set up.

This is required when upgrading to a modern (post-10.11 El Capitan) Mac OS X.
Homebrew now bundles its own Python3 installation instead of using the
system-provided default Python.


    # update homebrew
    brew update

    # uninstall git-cola and its dependencies
    brew uninstall git-cola
    brew uninstall pyqt5
    brew uninstall sip

    # re-install git-cola and its dependencies
    brew install git-cola

## WINDOWS INSTALLATION

**IMPORTANT** If you have a 64-bit machine, install the 64-bit versions only.
Do not mix 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

Download and install the following:

* [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

* [Git Cola](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/releases)

Once these are installed you can run *git cola* from the Start menu.

See "WINDOWS (continued)" below for more details.

# GOODIES

*git cola* ships with an interactive rebase editor called *git-xbase*.
*git-xbase* is used to reorder and choose commits when rebasing.
Start an interactive rebase through the "Rebase" menu, or through the
*git cola rebase* sub-command to start the *git-xbase* editor:

    git cola rebase origin/master

*git-xbase* can be launched independently of *git cola* by telling
`git rebase` to use it as its editor through the `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`
enviironment variable:

    env GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR="$PWD/share/git-cola/bin/git-xbase" \
    git rebase -i origin/master

# COMMAND-LINE TOOLS

The *git-cola* command exposes various sub-commands that allow you to quickly
launch tools that are available from within the *git-cola* interface.
For example, `./bin/git-cola find` launches the file finder,
and `./bin/git-cola grep` launches the grep tool.

See `git cola --help-commands` for the full list of commands.

    $ git cola --help-commands
    usage: git-cola [-h]
    
                    {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,config,
                     dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,
                     rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}
                    ...
    
    valid commands:
      {cola,am,archive,branch,browse,config,
       dag,diff,fetch,find,grep,merge,pull,push,
       rebase,remote,search,stash,tag,version}

        cola                start git-cola
        am                  apply patches using "git am"
        archive             save an archive
        branch              create a branch
        browse              browse repository
        config              edit configuration
        dag                 start git-dag
        diff                view diffs
        fetch               fetch remotes
        find                find files
        grep                grep source
        merge               merge branches
        pull                pull remote branches
        push                push remote branches

        remote              edit remotes
        search              search commits
        stash               stash and unstash changes
        tag                 create tags
        version             print the version

## HACKING

The following commands should be run during development:

    # Run the unit tests
    $ make test

    # Run tests and longer-running pylint and flake8 checks
    $ make check

    # Run tests against multiple python interpreters using tox
    $ make tox

The test suite can be found in the [test](test) directory.

The tests are set up to run automatically when code is pushed using
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/git-cola/git-cola).
Checkout the [Travis config file](.travis.yml) for more details.

Auto-format `po/*.po` files before committing when updating translations:

    $ make po

When submitting patches, consult the
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## SOURCE INSTALL

For Linux/Unix-like environments with symlinks, an easy way to use the latest
`git cola` is to keep a clone of the repository and symlink it into your
`~/bin` directory.  If `$HOME/bin` is not already in your `$PATH` you can
add these two lines to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` to make the linked
tools available.

        PATH="$HOME/bin":"$PATH"
        export PATH

Then, install git-cola by linking it into your `~/bin`:

        mkdir -p ~/src ~/bin
        git clone git://github.com/git-cola/git-cola.git ~/src/git-cola
        (cd ~/bin &&
         ln -s ../src/git-cola/bin/git-cola &&
         ln -s ../src/git-cola/bin/git-dag)

You should then get the latest `git cola` in your shell.

# WINDOWS (continued)

## Development

In order to develop *git cola* on Windows you will need to install
Python3 and pip.  Install PyQt5 using `pip install PyQt5`
to make the PyQt5 bindings available to Python.

Once these are installed you can use `python.exe` to run
directly from the source tree.  For example, from a Git Bash terminal:

    /c/Python36/python.exe ./bin/git-cola

## Multiple Python versions

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, the `contrib/win32/cola`
launcher script might choose the newer version instead of the python
that has PyQt installed.  In order to resolve this, you can set the
`cola.pythonlocation` git configuration variable to tell cola where to
find python.  For example:

    git config --global cola.pythonlocation /c/Python36

## BUILDING WINDOWS INSTALLERS

Windows installers are built using

* [Pynsist](https://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is also needed.

To build the installer using *Pynsist* run:

    ./contrib/win32/run-pynsist.sh

This will generate an installer in `build/nsis/`.

## WINDOWS HISTORY BROWSER CONFIGURATION UPGRADE

You may need to configure your history browser if you are upgrading from an
older version of *git-cola*.

`gitk` was originally the default history browser, but `gitk` cannot be
launched as-is on Windows because `gitk` is a shell script.

If you are configured to use `gitk`, then change your configuration to
go through Git's `sh.exe` on Windows.  Similarly, we must go through
`python.exe` if we want to use `git-dag`.

If you want to use *gitk* as your history browser open the
*Preferences* screen and change the history browser command to:

    "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/sh.exe" --login -i C:/Git/bin/gitk

*git-dag* became the default history browser on Windows in `v2.3`, so new
users should not need to configure anything.
